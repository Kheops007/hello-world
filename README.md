# hello-world
A new repository
Hi everyone!

Just the first day

Cristian here, this is my first first interaction with code.
I've read before a little bit, but never managed to start.

I want to make some modification for today in order to see the difference
Also, it is very interesting to see how the things go on

is this updating for me to see more in the main branch or just in this branch
Let's see
